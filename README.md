# SBG

This is a software repository for the [SBG (Structure Bioinformatics Groups)](http://ufq.unq.edu.ar/sbg/) from the UNQ (Universidad Nacional de Quilmes).

Our main interests are: Development of tools for the quality assessment of protein models; Study of the role of conformational diversity in protein evolution; Study of protein-protein interactions using structurally constrained models of sequence evolution; Study of the sequence-structure relationships in allergenic proteins.

This repository has information related to Conformational Space of Short Pepetides project. Where we calculated the structure of all peptides up to 5 Amino Acid, using Amber.
